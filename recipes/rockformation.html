<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The creation of a rock formation requires an eon of patience and time. I want to encourage you to not be afraid to try several times to get this recipe right. All rock formations are beautiful and create awe-inspiring landscapes and amazing photo opportunities. Be free to see the beauty in each of the formations cultivated.</p>

<p>This type of recipe may be difficult to envision for the beginner. If you are just starting out, it may be helpful to think of this as a similar cultivation project as for bonsai or rose arches, just scaled much, much larger.</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Erosion</li>
    <li>Erosion "activator" <em>Sand, wind, ice, or a combination of all of these.</em></li>
    <li>Butte or section of mountain or large rock several times the final desired size</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Select the starting rock mass.</li>
    <li>Direct chosen activator at sections of the mass to be eroded.</li>
    <li><em>For a more natural look:</em>Watch and wait.</li>
    <li><em>For specific designs:</em>Determine the best way to direct the chosen activator. This will highly depend on the site chosen. Some suggestions:
        <ul>
            <li>Series of smaller, more movable rocks to block and direct the activator as desired.</li>
            <li>Tall, sturdy trees used as suggested above. <em>For first-timers, there will definitely be sufficient time for tree growth, if none are currently onsite.</em></li>
            <li>If there is nearby water sources, convenient volcano, or handy glacier, consider re-directing ice, water or lava to speed up the process. <em>Note: while faster, there will be less time to correct design errors.</em></li>
        </ul>
        <li><em>Further design suggestions: </em>Arches and needles</li>
    </li>
</ol>
